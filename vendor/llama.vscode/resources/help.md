## Agent commands

### What are agent commands
Agent commands are a way to reuse often used prompts. They could be used to describe complex workflows or for simple instructions.   
Agent commands are stored in setting agent_commands and llama-vscode menu item "Agent commands..." could be used to manage them.
The command prompt could contain terminal commands in format !'<terminal_command>' (as in claude code.). The command prompt is preprocessed and the terminal commands are executed and replaced with the the result of the execution. Example: !'pwd' will be replaced with the the current directory.

### How to use them
Prerequisite: tools model is selected.
You could create agent commands from llama-vscode menu item "Agent commands..."\"Add agent command...". For creating a command with longer prompts you could export an existing command with "Agent commands..."\"Export agent command..." in a .json file, change the name and the prompt in the file and then import the new command with "Agent commands..."\"Import agent command...". 

In agent prompt text area press "/" - the available agent commands will be shown and could be selected. When selected, the command name is replaced with the longer prompt for this command and is sent to the AI model.  
Example:  
1. Select several lines of source code
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+A (or right click and select "llama-vscode: Show Llama Agent") - this will attach the selected lines to the prompt
3. Inside the agent prompt press "/" and select "explain"
The agent will explain the selected code.## Skills

### Overview
Llama-vscode support a simple auto memory for storing persistent data across conversations. The logic is as follows:
- The persistent memory is stored by the agent (when it considers necessary or if the user explicitly asks) in .md files in a project specific auto memory folder (for example /home/<user>/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/<project_id>/ggml-org.llama-vscode/auto_memory). (The agent is asked to use descriptive file names)
- On starting a chat with the agent, the list of the .md files names in the auto memory folder is added to the prompt. 
- The agent decides, based on the file name, what auto memory file to read (if any)

### How to use it
1. Make sure the setting auto_memory_enabled is checked (checked by default)
2. Make sure the setting max_auto_memory_files is greater than 0 (10 by default)
3. Start using the agent - it will automatically store the information, which it considers important for the future conversation in auto memory (or the user could explicitly ask something to be saved in auto memory).

Settings:
- auto_memory_enabled: If auto memory is enabled
- max_auto_memory_files: The max number of files to keep in auto memory (this is a hint to the AI not a strict limit)
## Chat with AI about llama-vscode  

### Requred servers
- Tools server

### How to use it 
This is a conversation with the llama-vscode help agent AI about llama-vscode, something like help how to use llama-vscode.
- From llama-vscode menu select "Chat with AI about llama-vscode" -> the agent will be opened
- Enter your question about llama-vscode
The first time it could take longer to answer. The following questions will be answered faster as the help information will be cached.
## Chat with AI

### Overview
Llama-vscode could be used as a VS Code copilot chat model provider. With other words llama-vscode could provide models for the copilot. The provided models could be from local models, openrouter.com or other appliation, which serves the tools models for llama-vscode. This way you could automatically download and start locally models by llama.cpp and llama-vscode and use them with Copilot for free.

### How to use it
1. Select/Start tools model from llama-vscode (local or external)  
<img width="485" height="875" alt="copilotSelectToolsModel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa33531-22f4-46dd-b429-7498c45c93e9" />
  
2. In VS Code Copilot show the models list -> Other Models -> Manage Models  
<img width="1404" height="754" alt="CopilotManageModels" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc861aa1-db86-46ff-83c1-98c7a435ad06" />
  
3. Make the models (all models available by the application serving the tools model are shown) you want to use visible (click on the left of the model name)  

4. Select the desired model from Copilot and start using it
## Custom eval tool

### Overview
llama-vscode provides to the users the posibility to partially create their own tool. Custom eval tool is a simple one - has one parameters and and uses the provided by the user javascript function to calculate the result.

### How to use it
Configure the description of the tool, the parameter description and provide a javascript function (one parameter, returns string) to be called when the tool is used.


Settings:
- Tool_custom_tool_eval_description: Description of the tool. This description will be used by the AI to decide if this tool should be used. Example: "Use this tool to check if a number is perfect."
- Tool_custom_eval_tool_property_description: Description of the tool only parameter. This description will be used by the AI to decide what to provide as parameter when using this tool. Example: "a natural number to check if it is perfect or not"
- Tool_custom_eval_tool_code: javascript function with one parameter, which returns string. Could be a path to a file with javascript function. Example: C:\temp\perfectNimber.js

## Custom tool

### Overview
llama-vscode provides to the users the posibility to partially create their own tool. Custom tool is a simple one - has not parameters and returns always the same result.

### How to use it
Configure the description of the tool and the returned result, enable the tool and ask the agent questions related to the tool.

Settings:
- Tool_custom_tool_description: Description of the tool. This description will be used by the AI to decide if this tool should be used. Example: "Use this tool for information about llama.cpp and llama serve - how to build it, how to use it, options, etc."
- Custom_tool_source: What should be returned by the tool. Could be file or a web page. Eample:  https://blog.steelph0enix.dev/posts/llama-cpp-guide/ ​The tool returns the content of the file or the web page.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50baa8c3-f426-4901-a443-8882da644800

## Delete models  

### Overview
Llama-vscode automatically downloads (if not yet done) models (LLMs) from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) if a local model (or env) is selected. The downloaded models are GGUF files. Once downloaded, the models are reused. The LLMs could take a lot of space on your hard disk. For example gpt-oss-20b-GGUF is 12GB.

### How to delete models
All downloaded models are stored in one standard folder:
- Windows: C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\llama.cpp.
- Mac or Linux: /users/<user_name>/Library/Caches/llama.cpp. 


You could delete the GGUF files from this folder. If they are missing, but are needed by llama-vscode, it will download them automatically again.



## Dialogs

### What are dialogs
The messages to the users are shown in dialog windows. There are two types of dialogs:
- Popup dialogs - the messages are shown in a popup window.
- Dialogs in the editor - the messages are shown in the editor.

The popup dialogs in some OS don't support scrolling, so they are not very good for long messages. The text from the pupup dialogs can't be copied to the clipboard.  

The dialogs in the editor support scrolling, so they are good for long messages. The text from the pupup dialogs can be copied to the clipboard.

### How to use them
llama-vscode uses popup dialogs for short messages and dialogs in the editor for long messages.  
The setting popup_max_chars (default 160) determines the maximum number of characters in the popup dialogs. If the message is longer than this number, it will be shown in a dialog in the editor.


Settings:
- popup_max_chars - determines what message to the user should be shown in a popup dialog (less than this number). If the message is longer, it will be shown in a dialog in the editor.## Edit Agent 

### Overview
Edit agent view is used for adding and editing agents. From there it is also possible to delete and copy an existing agent as a new one. The identifier of an agent is it's name. For now there is no tools model as part of the agent (the currently selected tools model will be used)

<img width="582" height="977" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a406e7a-09ea-4f04-9054-f709bcdb038a" />


### How to use it 
Edit agent view could be shown in one of the following ways:  
- In the left sidebar click llama-viscode button and after that on the upper part click button Show Edit Agent View (pencip image)
- From llama-vscode menu (Ctrl+Shift+M) select Agents...-> Add agent (or Edit agent or Copy agent)
- From environment view, when an agent is selected, click button Edit - this will show the selected agent in the Edit Agent View

![Edit with AI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7aef6a8-8c29-4278-b91f-9b3031c8cbd5)## Env

### What is env
Env (short for environment) is a group of models, agent and settings. Env makes it easier for the users to prepare the environment for their needs. Selecting an env with a given intent will make sure all needed servers are available. One env could contain up to 4 different models - for completions, chat, embeddings, tools. Env could also contain an agent and settings for enabling/disabling completions, rag and starting last selected env on startup. If the user wants to use only code completions functionality, he/she could select an env with only one model for completions. If the user wants to use all the functionality from llama-vscode, he/she could select an env with full package of models.

### How to use it
Select env for your needs from llama-vscode ui or from llama-vscode menu, "Select/start env...". This will select the models inside an env (and start the corresponding local servers), agent aand set the settings.
Deselect env from llama-vscode ui or from llama-vscode menu, "Deselect/stop env...". This deselect all models and agent (and stops the locally running servers, started by llama-vscode). The settings will not be changed.

There is a page in llama-vscode UI with the current environment details. From there it is possible to change the current environment and also save it (i.e. create a new env)

![Generate a commit message](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25f5d1ae-3673-4416-ba52-7615969c1bb3)## Health check

### Overview
Health check for the models is added. It works with llama.cpp server or other servers, which supports endpoint/health REST service. When the health check is enabled, the current state of the selected model is visible in the environment view. The health check is done every 30 seconds (could be changed from setting Health_check_interval_s). It could be triggered also manually by the user by clicking the appropriate button in the environment view (after the selected model name).

### How to use it
1. Enable health check in settings for the appropriate model (e.g. for completion Health_check_compl_enabled)
2. Open environment view and select the completion model (for example)
3. The health check will be monitored periodically and the status will be displayed in the environment view
4. Optionally, the health check can be triggered manually by clicking the appropriate button

Settings:
- Health_check_interval_s: The interval in seconds for the health check
- Health_check_compl_enabled: Enable/disable health check for completion model
- Health_check_chat_enabled: Enable/disable health check for chat model
- Health_check_embs_enabled: Enable/disable health check for embedding model
- Health_check_tools_enabled: Enable/disable health check for tools model

## Version 0.0.48 is released (01.06.2026)
## What is new

Thanks to @danielrobbins we have the following improvements:

- Fix chat context budgeting and overflow handling  
This is the main fix. The extension now behaves as a modern llama.cpp client that trusts and leverages live runtime information that the server makes available, including actual calls to get real tokenization numbers from the server when possible. Uses the full server API surface, and fails correctly when the budget is wrong.

- Fix empty streamed chat responses after compaction  
This fixes a streaming bug where a valid final response could be dropped and show up as empty.

- Polish empty-response diagnostics UI  
This improves the user-facing error and logging when the provider gets an empty response (clear reason rather than general error)

- Handle reasoning-only empty chat responses  
This handles the case where a reasoning model uses up the whole response budget internally and returns no visible text, causing an error.

- Raise chat output cap to quarter context window  
This removes an overly small fixed output limit and replaces it with a more reasonable cap based on the model’s context size (output cap is 0.25 of context window, which is reasonable as an emergency failsafe.)

- Log per-turn chat token usage  
This adds per-turn token usage logging so it is easier to see what each request and response is actually consuming.

- Fix shared-context model metadata display  
This fixes the context size shown in the VS Code model UI so shared-context llama.cpp models no longer appear to have roughly double their real window size (original PR fixed this to not report 12K context window)


## Version 0.0.47 is released (04.05.2026)
## What is new

- Multiline field for Edit with AI  
- Qwen3.5 models added as predefined (2B, 4B, 9B) - good for tools and chat  
- API Key is used (if needed and provided) on getting list of models on adding OpenAI Compatible model


## Version 0.0.46 is released (29.04.2026)
## What is new

llama.vscode could provide models for VS Code Copilot now:
1. Start tools model from llama-vscode (local or external)  
2. In VS Code Copilot show the models list -> Other Models -> Manage Models  
3. Make the models (all models available by the application serving the tools model are shown) you want to use visible (click on the left of the model name)  
4. Select the desired model from Copilot and start using it

Not needed tools from Copilot could be unchecked to reduce contex size if local model is used.



## Version 0.0.45 is released (04.03.2026)
## What is new

- Configurable debounce for inline completion requests - setting debounce_ms. 
llama-vscode will wait debounce_ms after a keystroke before sending a request to the LLM for inline code completion. If in the meantime there is another keystroke, the request for the previous keystroke is cancelled. Useful on low end hardware to avoid triggering code completion on every keystroke.

- Notification "Extension is updated" is shown only on version change, not on every setting change (as was before)


## Version 0.0.44 is released (03.03.2026)
## What is new

- Subagents implemented (with tool delegate_task) - now each agent, which has "Available as Subagent" checked could be used as a subagent

- new agent - Unit Test Writer

- new tool create_agent

- new agent "Agent creator"

- Files SOUL.md and USER.md (if available in the project root) will be added to the context

## How to use llama-vscode  

### Overview
llama-vscode is an extension for code completion, chat with ai and agentic coding, focused on local model usage with llama.cpp.

### How to use it 
1. Install llama.cpp  
- Show llama-vscode menu by clicking "llama-vscode" in the status bar or by Ctrl+Shift+M, and select 'Install/upgrade llama.cpp' (sometimes restart is needed to adjust the paths to llama serve)
2. Select env (group of models) for your needs from llama-vscode menu.  
- This will download (only the first time) the models and run llama.cpp servers locally (or use external servers endpoints, depends on env)
3. Start using llama-vscode  
- For code completion - just start typing (uses completion model)
- For edit code with AI - select code, right click and select 'llama-vscode Edit Selected Text with AI' (uses chat model, no tools support required)
- For chat with AI (quick questions to (local) AI instead of searching with google) - select 'Chat with AI' from llama.vscode menu (uses chat model, no tools support required, llama.cpp server should run on model endpoint.)
- For agentic coding - select 'Show Llama Agent' from llama.vscode menu (or Ctrl+Shift+A) and start typing your questions or requests (uses tools model and embeddings model for some tools, most intelligence needed, local usage supported, but you could also use external, paid providers for better results)


If you want to use llama-vscode only for code completion - you could disable RAG from llama-vscode menu to avoid indexing files.


If you are an existing user - you could continue using llama-vscode as before.


For more details - select 'View Documentation' from llama-vscode menu

## Llama Agent 

### Requred servers
- Tools server
- Chat server (if search_source tool is used)
- Embeddings server (if search_source tool is used)

### Overview
Llama agent uses AI and tools to answer questions, change and add files and do everythin eles, which is provided by the tools.  
Llama agent is still in development, but could produce some results with intlligent models with tools support.  
Llama agent doesn't ask for permission for each change of a file. Use VS Code's Source Control view or github to review and rollback (if needed) the changes.  
Llama agent asks for permission for executing terminal command. However, if the setting Tool_permit_some_terminal_commands is enabled, it will stop asking for permissions for some commands, which are considered safe.

### How to use it 
The best wey to prepare the environment for the agent is by selecting an Env (group of models). So, below is the standard workflow:
1. Select "Show Llama Agent" from llama-vscode menu or Ctrl+Shift+A to show Llama Agent. 
2. Click "Select Env" button and select env, which supports agent, for your needes. This will download the required models and start llama.cpp servers with them. For the external servers (like OpenRouter)   llama-vscode will ask for api key if needed.  
3. Write your request and send it with Enter or the "Send" button.  
4. During the agent loop you could also send prompt - enter a prompt and press Enter or click the second "Send" button (on the right side)

You could also use the agent only with tools model selected. In this case the tool search_source will use tools instead of chat server and filtering with embeddins server will be skipped.

Optional
- You could add files to the context with the @ button or just by entering "@". 
- You could select a command (predefined prompt) by pressin "/". The commands could be added frim llama-vscdoe menu - Agent commands...
- Activating an agent (Ctrl+Shift+A or from llama-vscodd menu) adds the open file to the agent context
- You could select source code and activate the agent (Ctrl+Shift+A or from llama-vscodd menu) to attach the selected lines to the context
- You could choose the tools to be used from "Select Tools" button (on the right side of "New Chat" button). If you have installed and started MCP Servers in VS Code, their tools will be available for selection too. Don't forget to click the OK button after changing the tool selection.

## Use as local AI runner (as LM Studio, Ollama, etc.) 

### Overview
llama-vscode could be used as a local AI runner (as LM Studio, Ollama, etc.) . Models are searched in Huggingface. After a model is selected, llama-vscode automatically downloads it and starts a llama serve with it. With this the user could start chatting with an AI.

### How to use it
1. From llama-vscode menu select "Use as local AI runner" - llama view will be opened with buttons "llama.cpp", "Add", "Select", "Chat".
2. Click "llama.cpp" button to install/upgrade llama.cpp (if not yet done). The installation for Windows (with winget) and Mac (with brew) is automatic. For Linux, the user should do it manually ([download the latest llama.cpp package for Linux](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases) and add the bin folder to the PATH)
3. Click "Add" button, enter search words to see a list of models from Huggingface, select a model, select quantization. If prefered - accept to start the model immediately. (not needed if the model is already added)
4. Click "Select" button and select a model to run (not needed if the model is already started in the previous step)
5. Click "Chat" button - a web page for chat with AI will be shown in VS Code

Enjoy talking with local AI.

### Requred servers
- Tools server

### Overview
llama-vscode could use the the tools from the MCP servers, which are installed in VS Code (part of VS Code's Extensions view). 

### How to use it 
1. Install MCP Server in VS Code 
- Select "Extensions" view from VS Code, 
- Open MCP Servers panel
- Click "Browse MCP Servers" (at the end of the "MCP SERVERS" line)
- Select and install MCP Server
2. Start the installed MCP Server 
- From the context menu of the MCP Server select "Start Server". VS Code should recognize the tools of the MCP Server.
3. Select "Show Llama Agent" from vscode-menu or use Ctrl+Shift+A (if needed select environment with agent/tools support). 
4. Click "Select Tools" from Llama Agent panel and select the tools, which you want to use from your MCP Server


## Menu  

### Requred servers

OR 
- Ctrl+Shift+M



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9895924d-1948-4f3c-b52e-2cce453645c8

## Model selection

### What is model selection
At a given time only one model could be selected (no model selected is also possible). If a model is selected, llama-vscode assumes this model is available at the endpoint for this model. If the model is local, the selection of a model starts a llama.cpp server with it.

### Why is model selection needed
This way is more clear what models for what will be used.

### How to use it 
There are different ways to select a model
- In Llama Agent click the button for selecting a model (completion, chat, embeddings, tools)
- In llama-vscode menu select "Completion models..." (or chat, embeddings, tools)
- Select an env. This will select the models, which are part of the env
## More context files

### What are AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, and USER.md
If in the project folder there are files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, and USER.md, they are used to provide additional context to the AI model when a request is sent. 
AGENTS.md - instructions related with agents
SOUL.md - instructions related with the "soul" of the agent (how to behave, what values to follow, etc.)
USER.md - information about the user - preferences, additional information, etc.
These files are not mandatory. Ther are added because in some systems are quite popular and probably could be reused from there.

### How to use them
Just add one or more of these files to the project folder.
## Parallel Completions

### Overview
Llama-vscode generates parallel code completions (default 3) if a version of llama.cpp after December, 6, 2025 (commit c42712b) is used. The next completion is shown by pressing Ctrl+], previous completion is shown by pressing Ctrl+[.  
The setting max_parallel_completions determines how many completions are generated.

### How to use it
1. Run the completion model and start coding
2. When a code completion is shown, press Ctrl+] to show the next completion, Ctrl+[ to show the previous completion
3. Alternatively - you could hover over the shown completion and when the toolbar is shown click the arrows to show the other completions.


Settings:
- max_parallel_completions: The max number of parallel completions to generate. Default is 3.

## Rules

### What are rules
Rules are additional user instructions that are added to the system prompt when an agent request is sent to the AI model. They are stored in a file, created by the user in a plain text or markdown format.
As llama-vscode provides the possibility to change the system prompt for the agents, additional instructions can be added to the system prompt and the result will be the same. The difference is that the rules from a file will be added to each agent system prompt on the fly.

### How to use them
The rules are optional. You could use rules file to add instructions to the system prompt - code writing conventions, code formatting, additional information about the project, etc.

There are two ways to configure rules:
- Create a new rules file under name llama-vscode-rules.md in the root of the project.
- In llama-vscode setting Agent_rules enter a path to a rules file. It could be relative to the project root or absolute path. If this is specified, the file llama-vscode-rules.md will be ignored.
## Setup llama.cpp server for Linux 

Make sure you have brew package manager installed (from https://brew.sh/). You could install brew with the command 
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```   
Show llama-vscode menu (Ctrl+Shift+M) and select "Install/upgrade llama.cpp" (if not yet done). After that add/select the models you want to use. 

Alternatively you could do it manually:

1. Download the release files for your OS from [llama.cpp releases.](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases) (or build from source).  
2. Add the bin folder to PATH, so that it is globally available

    - Chat with AI with project context  

*LLM type*  
    - Embedding    

*Instructions*  
Same like code completion server, but use embeddings model and a little bit different parameters.   
```bash
`llama serve.exe -hf nomic-embed-text-v2-moe-q8_0.gguf --port 8010 -ub 2048 -b 2048 --ctx-size 2048 --embeddings`  
```
## Skills

### Overview
Llama-vscode support skills (https://agentskills.io/home), which extend the capabilities of the LLM (similar to tools).

### How to use it
1. Set the skills folder in setting skills_folder (if not set, the <project_root>/skills is used)
2. Ask the agent for to do something, which requres a skill (or ask details about the skills)

On sending a user request to the agent, the folder is scanned and the available skills are provided to the LLM. If the LLM decides to use a partiular skill, the skill details are loaded by LLM.  


Settings:
- skills_folder: The folder where the skills are stored

## Subagents

### What are subagents
Subagents are a way to optimize the user of LLM context. Some tasks are be executed in a separate session and only the final result is added to the context of the original agent session. 
This is implemented with the tool delegate_task. If the delegate_task tool is enabled, the agent could decide to delegate some tasks to subagents. Each agent could be used as a subagent if it's field "Available as Subagent" is checked.

### How to use them
1. Make sure the tool delegate_task is enabled.
2. Make sure the agents you want to use as subagents have the field "Available as Subagent" checked and meaningful description.
3. Write a prompt, for which it is good idea to use the subagent. Alternatively, you could directly ask in the prompt to use the subagent.

The agent "Agent creator" makes it easier to create agents (which could be used as subagents).
## Telegram Bot

### Requred servers
- Tools server
- Embeddings server (if search_source tool is used)

### Overview
You can program from your phone with llama-vscode and Telegram. Part of the agent functionality of llama-vscode could be used from Telegram (i.e. from phone) via a Telegram Bot.  The user creates a Telegram Bot and sets it's token in setting telegram_api_token. After that all messages to this bot are forwarded to the agent in llama-vscode. The AI agent answers are sent to the user in Telegram. For security reasons, only users from a white list (setting telegram_bot_users) are allowed to use the bot. The bot answers, for example to /help command, are provided in the language, which is set in setting "Language". 

### How to use it 
1. Create a Telegram Bot and set it's token in setting telegram_api_token. Creating a bot in Telegram is simple - open bot @BotFather, click Start and execute the command /newbot. There you will see the bot API token.
2. Set the bot API token in setting telegram_api_token
3. Find your user id in Telegram (in Telegram bot @userinfobot send "/start") and add it to setting telegram_bot_users
4. Enable the bot in setting telegram_bot_enabled
5. From your Telegram (for example from your phone) send a message to the bot
The message will be forwarded to the agent in llama-vscode and the bot will send back the answer.
Here are the commands (messages, which starts with "/"), which the bot can execute (if the message doesn't start with "/", it is sent to the agent) :
/env - shows the current tools model and agent
/models - shows the available models
/agents - shows the available agents 
/setmodel n - sets the model to the n-th model. (models numbers are available from command /models)
/setagent n - sets the agent to the n-th agent. (agents numbers are available from command /agents) 
/stop - stops the agent 
/status - shows the current status of the agent 
/chat n - gets the last n  characters of the current chat. If n is not specified, the last 1000 characters are returned
/newchat - stops the current chat and starts a new chat
/setlang xx - sets the language, which is used by the bot: bg - Bulgarian (Български), cn - Chinese (中文), en - English, fr - French (Français), de - German (Deutsch), ru - Russian (Русский), es - Spanish (Español)
/ - shows available commands
/help - shows help information for using the bot

### Settings:
- telegram_api_token - Telegram Bot token
- telegram_bot_users - List of users, which are allowed to use the bot.
- telegram_bot_enabled - Enable/disable the bot
- telegram_chunk_size - The size of the chunks (in chars), which are sent as AI response to Telegram. Each chunk is a separate message.
- language - The language, on which the bot provides help and other bot specific answers.

## Update todos tool

### Overview
Llama-vscode provides a tool update_todo_list to the agent for planning and tracking the execution of the user request.

### How to use it
Update todos tool is based on Roocode's tool with the same name (the tool description is copied from Roocode). 
If the update_todo_list is enabled (selected), the agent could use it for planning non trivial tasks (user requests). This tools is used for both creating and updating the todo items. The todo items are saved in file <project_root>\.llama-vscode-todos.md. The todo items are updated by the agent to track the execution of the plan. This file is removed after the execution of the current user request is finished. If this file is updated by the user, the change might be taken into account by the agent. The content of the file (together with the inital user request) is sent to the agent periodically (every 5-th iteration by default, but this could be changed from setting plan_review_frequency). The agent could overwrite the user changes in the todo items file before reading it.  
Each time the agent uses the tool, the todo items are shown in the agent chat window. The state of the items tracked with [ ] (not started), [-] (in progres) [x] (finished)
Todo items are not reused between the user requests.

Settings:
- plan_review_frequency: Sets how often the todo items are sent to the agent to remind/review what is the current state of the plan
- tool_update_todo_list_enabled - controls if the tool is enabled

## Use cases  

### Overview
The use cases below describe how to prepare and use llama-vscode in some specific cases. There are already some configurations for models and env, which could be selected and used directly

### Only completion used, local server started by llama-vscode
- Use the default configuration if it works for you by selecting Env for your case
- If you want to use a different one, here is how to prepare it:
1. Create completion model - select llama-vscode menu -> "Completion models..." -> "Add completion model from Huggingface", find the model in Huggingface and add it.
2. From llama-vscode menu select "Deselect/stop env and models"
3. Create an env, which includes only this model - from llama-vscode menu -> "Env..." -> "Add Env...". A panel will be show with buttons for selecting completion, chat, embeddings and tools models. Click "Compl" button and select the newly added model (the name is hf: model_name_from_huggingface). Test if code completion works well. Click button "Add Env" to save the environment.

### Only completion used, external server
Extarnal server could be also a local one, but is not started by llama-vscode on selecting the model. The completion server should support /infill endpoint, which is currently available only by llama.cpp.
1. Create a new model - select llama-vscode menu -> "Completion models..." -> "Add completion model...". Enter only name and endpoint.
2. From llama-vscode menu select "Deselect/stop env and models"
3. Create an env, which includes only this model - from llama-vscode menu -> "Env..." -> "Add Env...". A panel will be show with buttons for selecting completion, chat, embeddings and tools models. Click "Compl" button and select the newly added model. Test if code completion works well. Click button "Add Env" to save the environment.
